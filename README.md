# MST_PrimsAlgorithm
This project implements the solution to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an undirected graph using Prim's algorithm. The graph consists of a source (0) and four load points (1, 2, 3, 4). The program reads the graph data from a text file, constructs the graph, and then finds the MST.
